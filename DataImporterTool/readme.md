#Data Importer tool

This tool is just for import into mongoDB the old data. It can be used only once.
There are two types of old Data:
- A set of `json` Files, that contain responses from WotBlitz Api. `Account files` - response on this request - https://api.wotblitz.eu/wotb/account/info/, and `tank files` - response on this request - https://api.wotblitz.eu/wotb/tanks/stats/. 
- An old SQL database from [previous version of the same project](https://github.com/DrMboga/WotBlitzStatician)

This tool uses WinForms :) With MVP pattern.
